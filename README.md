# Ski Guide App
Match yourself with local skiers whenever you’re skiing. Enter skill-level and get matched with a local skier who will show you around the slopes. Could possibly grow into a system where transactions are made too, guides enter how much they charge for a day or half-day, and then a review system as well. 

When you visit the site, you can enter dates and location for your trip, duration for the class, skill level and what type of skiing you want to do. The page will search for guides in that area who are available and the user can request to book them. 

If you’re a guide you can register and enter information about yourself, and availability, in order to be matched with a skier. 

## Data
The site will use these APIs:

https://openweathermap.org/

https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete

1. I will use React and Node for this project. 
2. I’m going to make an evenly focused full-stack application.
3. This will be a website, but it should also look good on mobile.
4. The goal will be to build a website which can match local skiers with tourists visiting who wish to learn the slopes from a local.
5. Skiers, and snowboarders. Basically people who want to guide others (and eventually make money doing so) and people who wish to learn about the ski system they’re going to from locals.
6. I will use https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/documentation/skiresort to provide snow reports. Moreover, I will build a backend with CRUD functionality in order for users to be able to register etc.
7. I will have a table for skiers, one for guides, and one for reservations. Skiers and guides will be linked through reservations, but skiers will also be able to favorite guides.
